# GeneticAlgorithm
This program accepts a source code (partially functioning method or program) as input, make changes to the code and evaluates through a fitness function 
and finally evolves the correct working version of the code through genetic algorithm process such as crossover, mutation, etc.

The source code tested here in this program is a method to detect prime number and thereby calculate square of value if prime, else return 0
